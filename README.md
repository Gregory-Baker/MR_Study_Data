### Participant 1
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** A couple of time I pressed 'A' to get the arm to move-- and I wasn't sure whether I was doing it correctly or whether the command had been registered-- so I had to press it a couple more times to be sure.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The ability to move my head to move the camera was useful and intuitive-- I found I didn't have to move the camera at all using the dpad on the controller. The control system was generally intuitive-- I was able to quickly learn how to control the robot.  
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** More feedback about the movement of the arm-- whether the system had correctly registered my button press to begin movement-- or telling me that something was wrong.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** When placing the barrel down at the final target-- the arm did not go all the way down and I was unclear how to proceed to get the barrel to be placed.
- **Errors:** The arm stopped moving and did not place the barrel down when I tried to confirm it-- perhaps as I did not place the object correctly. Move feedback about the arm movement and why it has stopped-- and how to proceed would help.
- **Positive:** The movement of the mobile robot with the point and click was very intuitive and easy to use-- enabling me to worry less about the movement of the mobile robot and be more observant of the surroundings. 
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** Greater feedback for the robot arm-- including why it has stopped and how to proceed. I found the minimap to be somewhat unclear and not entirely useful-- this may be down to the resolution of the VR headset. A superior VR headset would probably help the overall system-- providing a generally clearer view. 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** The ability to point and click and have the robot plan and move itself was very satisfying and reduced my need to constantly control the movement of the robot. I think the direct control was easier to pick up at the start-- but I think longer term the waypoint control would be preferable.  I preferred the arm control on the joystick-- I found it more intuitive at the start--  however I got the hang of the VR control eventually.  
- **Anything else:** I think my ideal system would actually be a combination of the two systems-- with waypoint control performed on the the joystick. I think I prefer the joystick/game controller to the VR controllers-- and a hybrid system of waypoints placed using the joystick would be good.
--------------------------

### Participant 2
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** bit of difficulty with reversing/ turning around (probably user error) in tight corner after collecting the barrel. would be prevented in future just by knowing the robot's limitations
- **Positive:** easy to learn and use
- **Negative:** slightly vertigo inducing 
- **Improvements:** could be smoother camera? 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** none
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** easy to use 
- **Negative:** the robot wobble on the stand while turning
- **Improvements:** slightly smoother camera? 

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** direct control felt smoother-- not being able to turn the robot on the spot in waypoint control felt very strange
- **Anything else:** this was a fun experiment :) 
--------------------------

### Participant 3
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Some slight mismtach between projected graphics and camera visuals due to wobble/jitter.  Scale of the robot is weird-- user feels like a giant piloting a tiny arm
- **Errors:** Grabbing system when releasing does not always release item-- but does provide some sort of feedback by colour. It is not entirely clear what do the colours represent.  Memory task might not be measuring the desired metric
- **Positive:** Features are exceedingly well thought out and integrated-- and performance is very robust. AR elements (pick up and mini-map) are intuitive to use-- clear and responsive. 
- **Negative:** Security elements not clear when active-- a sound alarm might help this.
- **Improvements:** More information regarding when a grip/release is possible or not.  Sound cues for safety features  Smoothing/stabilization of camera (digitally or physically)

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Borderline flawless-- discovered features as the trial went on  Actually put too much trust on the robot. Cylinder fell during the trial and did not realize until arriving at the target.  
- **Errors:** Cylinder fell during the trial-- likely due to a combination of the two. On the automated driving mode its easy to sit down and "enjoy the ride" and forget about the transportation task.
- **Positive:** Amazingly smooth operation. The point and click interface for driving offloads almost all the thinking to the robot. The VR system makes it easy to interact and quickly look for driving routes-- as well as looking at the surroundings.  
- **Negative:** FPS/resolution was lower on this mode (maybe?). the labels on the buttons were too small to read comfortably. 
- **Improvements:** Interface is useful but could be simpler. Treating the d-pads as both a simple button and as slider for twisting feels weird and breaks UI consistency. Maybe using one hand entirely for twisting and the other for clicking will help? 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** The automation features are amazing and add take the task off the user's shoulders. While the robot drives the user can explore comfortably and interact with the environment. The gripper is also more intuitive to control-- replicating the hand's movements 
- **Anything else:** Tutorial was very well implemented-- but feels awkward to interact with the camera focused on it. Moving it to a side or decoupling from the camera would allow to perform both at the same time.
--------------------------

### Participant 4
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** At first I wasn't sure how to rotate the robot whilst remaining stationary. At first I didn't expect the robot to navigate the environment autonomously-- but found that it did accidentally
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** '-The ability to override movement if needed  -Autonomous navigation  -I could rely heavily on the map overlay
- **Negative:** '-The yellow arrows on the virtual robot UI were a little difficult to see without looking down  -The camera view was pretty jumpy
- **Improvements:** '-Smoother camera feedback-A quicker way of rotating whilst stationary

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot behaved as I expected. However this may be because I have much more experience of using a standard game controller than VR controllers
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** '-The controls made the robot behave in the way that I expected and drive controls felt comparable to driving games I have played  -The intuitive control system allowed me to look around my environment more
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** '-A higher definition map -Smoother camera feedback

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** '-the familiarity of the Direct Control system allowed me to focus much better on the robot's surroundings and the task in hand
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 5
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Turning my head 180 to look behind caused a lot of shake as the camera can't function past 180deg
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Easy to use controls-- real time visual feedback
- **Negative:** Inherent sense of nausea that some people feel when using VR headsets
- **Improvements:** 180deg camera-- less jerky feedback

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Waypoint selectors require a lot less effort and also result in less feeling of nausea. More precise positions can also be selected
- **Negative:** Not bad but I would imagine that using the waypoint controllers for a long time may cause some people hand/arm/wrist strain.
- **Improvements:** An arm/wrist rest could resolve potential strain from holding the controllers

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** More observant to the environment using waypoint control. Also easier to use and felt that performance was more accurate. Also less feeling of nausea 
- **Anything else:** Well done Greg! You can have my data
--------------------------

### Participant 6
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** Placement/release of the object once held. I was looking at only the vertical stream-- rather than also at the position of the sphere-- so I accidentally gave the command for the robot to release the item in mid air.  A combination. At that point it had been implied but not said explicitly that the sphere was where the placement was-- so it took my a small amount of trial and error to get it right.
- **Positive:** Waypoints were an easy way to navigate. I liked that I could set a future waypoint before the current section was complete
- **Negative:** The path between the current position and waypoint was only revealed once the target had been confirmed. It might help ese of use if there is a sort of projected trajectory as well as the projected endpoint when setting the target.
- **Improvements:** Perhaps the direction of the headset could be compensated against the turning of the robot. i.e. as the robot turns clockwise-- the headset turns counter-clockwise at the same pace.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Reversing left/right was the other way round than I expected (not the same as driving a car)
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Quick response-- could pick and drive at the same time
- **Negative:** I had to keep looking down to check for collisions (perhaps unnecessary) which made me quite dizzy
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I felt more directly in control. Although the waypoint control could be better if the terrain were more uneven
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 7
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot behaved as expected
- **Errors:** Accidentally the pressed the button the VR headset-- other errors were expected to happen.
- **Positive:** nan
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** The visualize path of the robot did not work perfectly when next to the box when the cylinder was supposed to be placed.
- **Errors:** More practice with using the VR System would get rid of the human and robot error because of better understanding of the system.
- **Positive:** Being able to visualize and set up the path of the robot before executing the command to do so.
- **Negative:** The shaking of the camera when the robot was moving.
- **Improvements:** Maybe if the camera was attached to a drone and being able to use the drone to control the path of the robot but that maybe be too complicated. There was no vertical capability of the robot to go up or down.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Being able to setup beforehand when you are going.
- **Anything else:** The controller was initially more easier to use which could be because I have used controller before but the waypoint was easier to use when setting up the path of robot after the initial hurdle of learning. But controlling the robotic arm was personally easier when using the control.
--------------------------

### Participant 8
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I accidently tabbed on the d-pad and the waypoint control was interrupted
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** nan
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** nan
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** nan
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 9
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** I probably didn't use the camera angle enough to be precise with movements
- **Positive:** It felt very responsive-- became easier during the experiment
- **Negative:** Nothing
- **Improvements:** Nothing

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Easy to navigate as the experiment progressed. My own human error in remembering which buttons to press
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Being able to point and place with the right controller was helpful
- **Anything else:** Great fun!
--------------------------

### Participant 10
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I rotated using the right controller then used the reverse function on the left-- I expected that to apply the reverse movement on my rotated position but because I had not used the right trigger my robot remained in its current orientation.
- **Errors:** Slightly bumped hazardous material platform-- human error. Other than that nothing.
- **Positive:** Very simple to use-- could pick it up in a number of minutes.  Good pathfinding which reduced the number of required waypoints.
- **Negative:** Would be nice to turn the camera completely. Slightly blurry-- particularly reading the buttons on the controllers with the headset on (may be slightly because I took my glasses off!)
- **Improvements:** ability to move whilst robot arm is returning to home after collecting/dropping objects. 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot behaved exactly as expected.
- **Errors:** None
- **Positive:** Very simple to control. Only a handful of buttons to remember.
- **Negative:** Nothing. 
- **Improvements:** Increasing speed of robot drive or arm could speed up this robot's ability to complete tasks

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Perhaps prior experience in gaming with a controller made that more comfortable for me.
- **Anything else:** No
--------------------------

### Participant 11
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** When reversing the movement was mirrored but after realising this it was easy to control
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The image wasnt overly jittery like some vr headsets and there was little lag. The placing of targets instead of using the joysticks for robot arm movement was very useful
- **Negative:** nothing
- **Improvements:** the robot arm seemed to go lower than expected

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot Tried to navigate through wall due to incomplete slam map-- 180 degree limitation made reversing tricky
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** being able to put the targets and rotation for the movement was very convenient and useful. especially for navigating around obstacles
- **Negative:** moving to the targets made me feel motion sick
- **Improvements:** maybe some smoothing when moving between targets on the camera. the target placing could have a feature where you can place the target on the slam map rather than casting it which would improve going around tall obstacles

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** the motion sickness in the vr is the reason for the ranking. if I was using this all day however the vrs route planning would make my job a lot easier (the target plotting)
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 12
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** TURNING CORNERS I EXPECTED THE ROBOT TO TAKE THE CORNERS TOO TIGHTLY AND CRASH BUT IT DIDNT  SOMETIMES AT THE START OF MOVEMENTS THE ROBOT TURNED UNEXPECTEDLY
- **Errors:** AFTER GIVING A WAYPOINT FAR AROUND A CORNER-- I DIDNT EXPECT THE ROBOT TO NAVIGATE ALL THE WAY AND THOUGHT IT WOULD CRASH INTO A CORNER. I STOPPED THE ROBOT HALFWAY ALTHOUGH JUST RESUMED CONTROL AND THEN IT MADE IT NO PROBLEM. 
- **Positive:** ORIENTATION CONTROL WITH THE THUMBPAD FOR WAYPOINT SETTING  CLICK AND DRAG MOVEMENTS TO SET ARM WAYPOINTS
- **Negative:** HEAD CONTROL SEEMED TO FOLLOW THE ROBOT ONCE IT WAS ON A SET PATH WHICH WAS QUITE DISORIENTATING  BUTTON PRESSES TO MOVE THE HEAD CONTROL DIDN'T OFFER MUCH EXTRA
- **Improvements:** KEEP HEAD CONTROL STATIONARY WHILE MOVING-- ONLY MOVE AS MY HEAD MOVES

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** GRASPING THE BARREL THE ARM MOVED IN A VERY LONG PATH TO THE TARGET AND GOT TANGLED IN ITSELF.
- **Errors:** PLACING THE OBJECT I WASN'T SURE IF THE TARGET HAS BEEN CONFIRMED SO I DECIDED TO MOVE THE BASE CLOSER TO THE TARGET. HOWEVER THE ROBOT HAD STARTED PERFORMING THE ACTION AND THEN HAD TO STOP MIDWAY.
- **Positive:** INTUITIVE CONTROLS TO MOVE THE ROBOT.  EASIER TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE BASE AND ARM CONTROLS AS THEY USED TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUTTONS.  CAMERA MOVEMENTS MATCHED THE HEAD.  MINIMAP WAS GREAT
- **Negative:** VIBRATIONS IN THE CAMERA WERE QUITE CONFUSING. LEFT RIGHT  MOVEMENT BUTTONS FOR THE CAMERA WEREN'T NEEDED
- **Improvements:** OVERLAY DESCRIPTORS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. E.G. WHERE ARE THE NO GO ZONES FOR THE ROBOT-- HOW CLOSE CAN YOU GET TO THE CORNERS WITHOUT CRASHING?

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** MORE INTUITIVE SYSTEM BUT DID REQUIRE ME TO PAY ATTENTION THE WHOLE TIME. IF CAMERAS COULD BE TURNED OFF OR MINIMISED TO A SMALLER WINDOW TO MONITOR WHILE THE ROBOTS MOVING IN WAYPOINT CONTROL THEN I'D PROBABLY PREFER THAT. POSSIBLY AFTER HAVING MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SYSTEM AND UNDERSTANDING IT'S LIMITATIONS THEN I'D CHOOSE WAYPOINT CONTROL
- **Anything else:** NOTHING TO ADD
--------------------------

### Participant 13
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** I was expecting lower resolution and worse latency but the system was above my expectations. The system gave me a good understanding of the area and map as well as the depth and geometrical position of the objects
- **Errors:** I would have preferred to control the camera rotation with X and B button instead of the D-pad. I didn't rotate my head due to emerging motion sickness but I found it useful to look down and know where the robot wheels-- body and arm were when navigating. The robot arm pushed the barrels against the surfaces with a worrying force. Apart from that all the execution went perfect and it was enjoyable.
- **Positive:** 3D vision-- minimap of the surroundings-- resolution-- sound-- smoothness of the movements
- **Negative:** Navigation speed too slow-- and navigating while rotating the camera was difficult-- delay when turning my head as it started to cause sickness.
- **Improvements:** User interface design and responsiveness

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I was probably expecting more complex interaction and movements so that I could do several things at once. I felt that I could do all the navigation planning in the mini-map and then stay alert to stop the robot if something chances. I also expected that the navigation algorithm detected all walls which did not once and then I started to be more cautious.
- **Errors:** I kept using the trigger to start the grabbing function. Somehow-- I did not learnt this so easy. The robot bumped into an object or did some weird movements while navigating which caused me to be more careful
- **Positive:** Option of grasping an object by moving my hand. Also the option of planning the movement first and then exploring the area while the robot is navigating.  
- **Negative:** For the first option to effectively happen-- I need to trust the robot and somehow be sure that it will do a correct navigation. If this fails then-- the useful aspect of "auto-pilot" is not as good.
- **Improvements:** Grabbing objects using the trigger to activate them-- improving SLAM or robot awarenes of the area. Possibility to work on the minimap first and then add flexibility during navigation to stop or change the route

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I chose the direct control over VR controllers as I was suspicious of the robot's machine learning algorithms. If the robot would have done a correct navigation. it would have chosen VR controllers. 
- **Anything else:** When using the VR controllers. the robot did not correct the view. I had to manually do this which was causing awkward situations or sudden movements
--------------------------

### Participant 14
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot was very easy to control precisely.
- **Errors:** When the robot MR is not in the mini map-- navigation should be careful. And needed some time get used to the buttons.
- **Positive:** MR is very good and accurate that reduces lot of manual work precision and accuracy.
- **Negative:** May be the brightness and lighting of the VR system can be adapted!
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The system is very good and easy to use. 
- **Errors:** There was none! The system behaved flawlessly.
- **Positive:** The system is very easy to work with joystick as you have full control of the robot.
- **Negative:** It might be tiring to do navigation for long periods of time.
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Both have their own merits and demerits.  The picking task is similar in both - just the buttons are different.  The navigation task is what makes it different. The VR is very easy and can be used for long periods of time for navigation task but can cause motion sickness. Also-- because the robot does all the navigation-- the spatial awareness or immersive experience was quite low for me. Of course-- I can sit and watch but the robot has all the fun so its boring. Whereas with direct control-- because I have more control of the robot-- I feel more aware and immersed and take time to understand the environment. Again-- this cannot be done for a long time and might tire easily.  I would go with switching both the system now and then for use depending on the user's fatigue.
- **Anything else:** Nah
--------------------------

### Participant 15
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** pressing the grab button but the robot needed me to press it a second time.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** I really liked how well integrated the VR headset was with the the camera on the robot. I really enjoyed how easy it was to control. 
- **Negative:** I cannot think of any thing bad about the system.
- **Improvements:** communication from pressing a button to the robot performing the action.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I think it was more human error whilst trying to turn the robot. I was expecting it to turn on the spot-- and I had some difficulty getting it to do so.
- **Errors:** It was definitely my error remembering the controls
- **Positive:** the movement operation was good
- **Negative:** remembering all the controls 
- **Improvements:** simpler controls

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I would say it had to do with my level of experience with each control system-- but I felt the controller joysitck was easier to use and more intuitive. 
- **Anything else:** I thought it was a great experience
--------------------------

### Participant 16
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot behaved mostly as expected-- although I didn't expect the movement to be as jarring when it was stopping/starting or turning. I also didn't expect it to be able to navigate paths for waypoints as well as it did
- **Errors:** I misplaced the dot on the robot arm during the tutorial as I didn't realise the dot had to be on the floor (as opposed to where it picked the object up from). Maybe either add this clarification into the tutorial or change the place graphic so that it's clear it should be on a floor
- **Positive:** It was fairly intuitive and didn't require many controls. The waypoint system was very good
- **Negative:** The lag in vision as well as general blurriness from the VR headset made it slightly disorienting at the start.
- **Improvements:** Smoother visual input would've helped a lot-- the overall control felt very good though

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** I expected the ride to be smoother
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** It was very intuitive and simple to use
- **Negative:** The robot was quite clunky at stopping and starting. When using the joystick manually there were a lot of stats-- stops-- turns etc and this meant the visual input was quite jarring when it was shaking a lot.
- **Improvements:** Some smoothing/damping of either motion or input maybe would help make it less shaky

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** It was much easier and smoother to use
- **Anything else:**  just being able to pick a location far away and not have to worry about navigating or avoiding obstructions made it a lot simpler. The motion itself was also a lot smoother.
--------------------------

### Participant 17
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Worked fine. Only reverse parking was challenging
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** It was overall easy to use and made picking up the barrel and driving very easy
- **Negative:** Blurry vision and reverse parking was challenigng
- **Improvements:** better reverse vision

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** All good except for the path planning one time. High distance path planning lead to a crash
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Path planning is overall easy though control can be slightly confusing at times.
- **Negative:** Path planning for long distance goal failed
- **Improvements:** Path planning could be a bit better plus easier control

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** easier path planning although the control is a bit more challenging
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 18
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Tried to reverse after object placed-- but didn't seem to work initially-- so used waypoint method to rotate the robot instead.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Waypoints were easy to place and gave time to adjust while the robot was moving towards them. 
- **Negative:** Little bit of time needed to get used to using waypoint while reversing. 
- **Improvements:** a way of seeing behind the robot while reversing?

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Very intuitive
- **Negative:** Needed more focus and dexterity to control going around tight corners for example compared to waypoints. 
- **Improvements:** A better driver

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Easier to control during motion over long distance
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 19
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The arm activation (with the ball turning yellow) was occasionally tricky. Overall the experience was better than previous controls sheme
- **Errors:** Ball turning yellow / red.Driver overly enthusiastic and almost knocking the barrel off while driving away
- **Positive:** Ability to both move and issue commands to the arm using the same controls. Arm would act independently once the order has been issued 
- **Negative:** Nothing in particular 
- **Improvements:** Tell the ball to sort it's colour out

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot behaved in the right way. Controller did not (I mean the human behind the robot-- not the actual controller) 
- **Errors:** Blindness and memory of a gold fish
- **Positive:** Once location is set-- the robot was able to navigate itself to the right space without further user input-- resulting in less human errors. 
- **Negative:** Takes longer for the human (this one specifically) to get a handle on the controls. The need to read is bad for blind people. 
- **Improvements:** Relaxing music? 

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Direct control felt more natural and mirroring to human body/ 
- **Anything else:** The confusing ball of doom was confusing
--------------------------

### Participant 20
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The fact that I could change desired location while the robot was still travelling to the previous one.
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** wider camera angle

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The use of a joystick to control everything
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Easier to coordinate
- **Anything else:** The pads are very uncomfortable
--------------------------

### Participant 21
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Intuitively I expected the steering to be reversed when the robot was reversing-- though found this was not the case.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Great to be able to look around using the movement of the VR headset while driving the robot. Automated picking and placing makes controlling the robot arm very easy. Driving the robot is easy via a familiar controller setup.
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** Having to continually give controller input and steer the robot on simple paths becomes tiring after a while.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Waypoint control reduces fatigue during long movements. Semi automated pick and place makes controlling arm easy.
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Generally a more 'pleasant' experience using waypoint control. Reduces fatigue caused by continual control of the robot's movement. Removing the need for continual control means more attention can be paid to the environment and surroundings of the robot.
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 22
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** rotated when got to location - expected it to be same rotation
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** path planning long distances
- **Negative:** close waypoints are fairly unintuitive to place
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** i drove the robot too close to the wall and a plinth and dragged the arm along it-- didn't realised how wide the robot was on that side (left)  a warning proximity sensor on that side would help
- **Positive:** very good and instant control over robot location 
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** ease of precision control of robot and arm location
- **Anything else:** nan
--------------------------

### Participant 23
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot stopped it self. I was expecting it to hit. It gave me confidence to move as close as possible to the object.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** It pickup cylinder itself .Arm movement was really helpful.
- **Negative:** I dindt find anything bad
- **Improvements:** Design of indicator can be improved. Which indicates where to hold and place an object. It lacks affordance. It didn't give user the idea what it is without tutorial.IT should be redesigned.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** MY expectation was after selecting waypoint robot should have gone there quickly. But it was slow. No point of implementing waypoints if robots move in the same speed as in the joystick mode. Robot rotation was better than joystick it rotate it self that was good point
- **Errors:** Way point arch was too big. It prevented me from choosing the right way point.
- **Positive:** Rotation of robot was good in this mode
- **Negative:** VR controller were very confusing. Oculus quest has better controller it has joystic.  Driver lose focus after choosing waypoint. 
- **Improvements:** Arch pointing can be improved.

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** You remain focused and engaged with the tasks. In waypoint you put less effort that is less demanding but boring
- **Anything else:** nothing

### Participant 25
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot behaved as expected-- recognising the need to give obstacles additional space/clearance due to its tracks. The controls could have benefited from activating both thumb sticks simultaneously so the camera and steering could operate in tandem.  
- **Errors:** As above. Greater alignment of the joystick functions (camera and steering) would increase speed and accuracy of navigation and reduce the amount of obstacles hit.
- **Positive:** The camera resolution was fantastic. The 'A' grasping  and 'back' functions were really neat too.
- **Negative:** The movement of the robot was a bit clunky-- but then to be expected due to its tracks.  I kept releasing the LB button in error when moving-- so some kind of 'lock' might be helpful so the camera and steering could be operated at the same time.  
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** the system had some good functions-- but lots weren't intuitive. I also kept forgetting the key board functions. 
- **Errors:** I found it difficult to steer difficult via the keyboard. 
- **Positive:** the fast forward movement was useful. 
- **Negative:** A home button to return the robot to its original start position would be a good addition. 
- **Improvements:** I'm not a fan of the keyboard operation.

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Greater operability and ease of use.
- **Anything else:** nan

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** robot mostly functioned normally--  At one point the view camera control disconnected so I could not move it. I mostly chose to give line of sight waypoints as I didnt know how good the vehicle motion planning was-- when I accidentally gave it a waypoint round a corner-- i was suprised how good the planning was and started using further away waypoints. 
- **Errors:** At one point the view camera control disconnected so I could not move it. 
- **Positive:** I think it was a very intuitive system where I didnt have to think about the exact motion of the vehicle too much. It was very easy to pick up and use and allowed me to do a task without issue. It simplifies the challenge of controlling an arm and a vehicle.
- **Negative:** The platform was rather jittery. Can't think of anything unhelpful in particular! When switching between the arm and robot-- I sometimes forgot I was in the other mode. 
- **Improvements:** When picking up an object I wanted to know whether my arm could reach it-- so having some range visualisation would be useful. Having a smoother camera would have been nice. Maybe some sound cues as well on successful pickup-- on moving to waypoint and so on. 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Nothing unexpected
- **Errors:** No errors
- **Positive:** I felt in control of the vehicle at all times. I felt it was also very intuitive 
- **Negative:** In games often one stick controls the character-- while the other controls the camera-- I found it hard to control the camera at the same time as moving as the were both on the same side of the controller. 
- **Improvements:** Moving camera-- having HUD prompts as to which buttons to press for which actions. 

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I have a lot of experience with driving games-- so I felt much more at ease with direct control for the short duration of the experiment. 
- **Anything else:** Duration - while it was nice to be in control for this short experiment. I imagine that if the distances or durations were longer it would be a lot more comfortable having the vehicle do more of the active control.

**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** could not turn the camera right round to help reversing
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** fun to use-- easy to use after instruction
- **Negative:** hard to move the camera and the robot at the same time.
- **Improvements:** camera and movement mapped to different sticks. left arm made it look like the robot was wider than it was

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** the robot navigated around object better than expected  
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** quick.  dont need to worry about the robot running into things  optimal path calculated for you  dont need to worry about how the robot will get to your way point
- **Negative:** camera quite shaky--  camera movement could be more fluid
- **Improvements:** more fine grain control of camera.  place way points on map

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** quicker to get the robot to the goal--  easier to control the robot-- just needed to place way points not worry about detailed navigation
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 28
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Movement felt jerky-- especially while turning-- leading to concern that it might crash into a barrier and  drop the object
- **Errors:** Occasionally felt i crashed into a barrier due to narrow space on the turn. to correct it-- adjust the position manually slightly and hen place the target.
- **Positive:** Ease of use-- once trained and with practice.
- **Negative:** The perception and position of the target using the virtual image-- takes getting used to. 
- **Improvements:** smoother motion-- better use of camera rather than the virtual robot.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Jerky motion during turning-- especially bigger turns.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** ease of control-- since there is only one device and robot
- **Negative:** concentration required since the operator is the path planner / driver. leads to stress and constantly checking the environment.
- **Improvements:** smoother motion during turn.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** 1) Robot does the path planning for you-- but only after you get used to the virtual robot. This will lead to less stress in a real life task.  2) Will be quicker and more productive  3) lesser human error-- since in VR the operator is driving the robot and has to concentrate constantly.

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** None
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Intuitive controls-- worked reliably
- **Negative:** camera control not the best-- jerky
- **Improvements:** smooth camera control

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Tried to take a path through a barrier when setting an ambitious waypoint
- **Errors:** Poor barrel placement-- seems inconsistent
- **Positive:** Waypoint control makes navigation less taxing
- **Negative:** Difficult to orient the robot once at a picking/placing station 
- **Improvements:** Keyboard control for fine adjustment of orientation

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Felt more intuitive and more in control
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 30
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I was trying to use the robot arm when the mobile base was not positioned perfectly/close to the target for the barrel. When positioning the target arrow for the arm it hit an indivisible wall and wouldn't not move further than a certain point and I assumed this meant it was out of bounds for the robot arm to reach.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** It was very intuitive to use and very close to how I would expect to control a mobile robot from a large distance. 
- **Negative:** Nothing
- **Improvements:** Having a dedicated emergency stop button near the user. 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot arm took a little long to dock after placing the barrel down at the target
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Joystick control of the camera was better also using the arm and switching between functions was easier
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** An options to use the joystick but being able to toggle to waypoint control and use the joystick as the input device in addition or alternative to the mouse.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Once the behaviour of the robot was relatively understood and a fair amount of trust in it was reached I like being able to tell the robot where to go and it figures it out for itself rather than me having to constantly be aware of it surrounds myself. 
- **Anything else:** nan

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Intuitive control. Automatic arm control based on desired end point. Camera was able to be moved independently of the arm.
- **Negative:** Robot rattled/shook during some turns
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The camera could easily be moved while moving between waypoints making the environment much easier to map out with the eye
- **Negative:** The lack of direct control made it feel at times like the robot would crash while moving between waypoints-- although it never did
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Preference: Direct Control

### Participant 32
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot performed as expected.
- **Errors:** There were no errors during this trial
- **Positive:** The visuals are good. The cameras help to navigate-- but the map gave some reassurance. The controllers were easy to understand. It was good to see how the robot path was indicated with the red arrow.
- **Negative:** Too many different keyboard functions to remember
- **Improvements:** a different controller for the robot

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** There were no misbehaviour. The robot did follow the commands. However-- the arm was a bit slow.
- **Errors:** There were no errors during the trial
- **Positive:** The use of a joystick makes it easier to control-- makes it quicker and more personal with the manual feeling of the joystick. The map helped to make sure the robot doesn't hit any obstacles.
- **Negative:** The cons are that there is no waypoint to fix/consider-- so it's prone to accidents if the map is not followed. The waypoint gives a level of assurance of the position.
- **Improvements:** incorporating waypoints as an option?

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I feel with more control of the robot with the joystick-- makes it more personal and I can quickly react to the environment. Whereas with the waypoint you feel that you already gave a command and lose control of the robot movements.
- **Anything else:** I think the waypoint option could be incorporated into the joystick as an alternative movement method if the controller decides to. At some points-- it is easier to use a waypoint-- for instance long straight paths. Also-- the camera should be 360 for a better understanding of the environment.
--------------------------

### Participant 33
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot behaved exactly how I expected-- it moved pretty smoothly - slightly bumpy on occasion. The use of the camera was great. The arm moved seamlessly and I had no issues at all. Turning the robot was also straight forward and I did not get stuck anywhere.
- **Errors:** There were no issues during this trial.
- **Positive:** The joystick controller was simple and easy to use. Once I had an understanding of the controls-- I found it easy to manoeuvre. The use of the different camera angles was also really helpful land allowed me to gain a good understanding of the surroundings. The system to pick up/put down the cylinder was also straight forward to use.
- **Negative:** The robot can be slightly bumpy - but not really an issue.
- **Improvements:** Maybe the option for a camera zoom in/out - although definitely not necessary.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot was more difficult to control using this control and I felt like I could not control it as well - such as turning corners and moving forwards/backwards the length that I needed. I struggled a little to line the robot up when collecting the cylinder and had to reverse and reposition myself. It was also more difficult to turn/rotate on the spot.
- **Errors:** I had to think a lot whilst using the controls and it did not feel smooth or well integrated. It was definitely more confusing and not as comfortable as the joy con controller. This could be prevented by using a different control method that is easier to implement.
- **Positive:** It was good that there were separate controls for both the camera and the robot - this minimised the confusion a little bit. I also liked the fact that there was the mouse for the robot-- but also the forward / back keyboard arrows. I used these to move around the corners and position myself better.
- **Negative:** It was definitely confusing having various keys to use for the robot-- camera and also using the robot arm. This is quite a complex system compared to the joycon and more difficult to control.
- **Improvements:** A simpler means of control-- or less controls to use. It would take more practice to be comfortable with the controls. A way to better gauge how far forwards/backwards you are moving. Also-- the camera does not rotate a full 360-- so once you get to 180 if you want to look the other way you need to spin back around again.

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I personally found the joycon controller much easier to use and I grasped an understanding much quicker. The waypoint control has a lot of keys and different controls to understand in a short amount of time. I also found it much more difficult to move around and have spacial awareness.
- **Anything else:** Really interesting and a great insight into using robots. I found a clear winner out of the two controls-- in terms of which was easier to use and I felt the most confident with. Thank you Greg! :)

**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I forgot to press enter when I had directed the robot to move round.  I found the golf ball and stick method of controlling the arm difficult to get used to.  I expected the robot to behave more like an RC model-- so had to learn how best to use these controls.
- **Errors:** Once I had placed the cylinder down-- I forgot to press tab to switch control back to the vehicle. So I nearly tipped it over when I pressed the cursor. Once the arm is parked it could automatically switch off control or give a prompt to check before moving.  Clearer onscreen display would also help.
- **Positive:** Controls were ok ish.
- **Negative:** I would have liked a bigger lidar display screen with clearer mapping.
- **Improvements:** Practise.  The arm positioning icon could be improved. Audio feedback to let me know what action was selected.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Behaved as I expected.
- **Errors:** None
- **Positive:** Clear response to joystick control.  Did what I expected with immediate feedback.
- **Negative:** Would have liked clearer lidar view
- **Improvements:** Clearer indication of switching between vehicle and arm

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Faster feedback to control inputs.
- **Anything else:** There seemed to be less congnitive load with the joystick

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** i dont recall any instances where it behave d worse than my control inputs aprt from stalling once
- **Errors:** i caused a couple of wrong turns more experience would remove the likelihood of this 
- **Positive:** its soundly based system and easy to use 
- **Negative:** rearward vision was poor
- **Improvements:** rearward vision would help in backing up

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** i cant recall any 
- **Errors:** it stalled once 
- **Positive:** uses common control method 
- **Negative:** slightly more awkward getting camer into good postion
- **Improvements:** all around vision

#### Preference: Waypoint Control

- **Improvements:** rear camera

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The controls felt more like i can full control 
- **Negative:** It felt more stressful as I felt the other method felt like I couldn't make any mistakes as the robot did the moving for me

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** much more fluid movement than the previous experiment  controls felt significantly more 'natural'  love the jumpy janky sketchy bumping nature of the roads arm movement didn't stop robot movement i.e. could move both at the same time which felt great
- **Negative:** i am assuming there is a distance detector / proximity sensor that means the robot won't respond if there's something directly in front of it. This caused a minor issue when i wanted to go but the arm was moving the object across that field of view at the time and the system momentarily stopped. heckin janky
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** shame it can't reverse
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** nan
- **Negative:** nan
- **Improvements:** instead of overwriting a previous command-- logging it into a list of actions would feel more streamlined. Can hotkey a button to 'clear' the list to keep it from clogging would be good

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** felt more natural-- likely due to being an experienced gamer
- **Anything else:** need NoS

### Participant 38
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** getting near to the box object-- wasn't sure if it was as close as I tried to put it and if it would be able to reach the barrel but I guess the more practice you had with the system you would pick up things like that 
- **Errors:** Sometimes had to press enter again
- **Positive:** easy to use and quick to pick up. Easy to tab between function of moving around and picking up the item. I think with several uses most people could get quite quick and efficient with the system
- **Negative:** the camera angle meant you had to move the camera around a bit to see where to go but not a major issue.
- **Improvements:** Maybe a wider angle lens on the camera 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** crashed into wall slightly when I didn't think I was that close to it but other than that behaved as expected 
- **Errors:** I got confused on one bit and was trying to navigate with the wrong joystick after picking up the object
- **Positive:** fairly easy to use. I prefer the mouse option though but still easy to use. Nice to be able to continuously move.
- **Negative:** I think I struggled a bit to see a bigger view and Id like the option to click to a point then move like on the other control
- **Improvements:** Could the camera be higher up and wider angle lens to give a better overall view without having to keep turning? 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** I'm more used to a mouse and keyboard so I found it easier to navigate personally and felt more in control with that that with the Joystick. I found the mouse to be more precise too-- especially with picking up the barrel and less motor control needed compared to the joystick but again-- that might be because I am not used to using a joystick and more familiar with mouse and keyboard
- **Anything else:** Overall I fund it easy to pick up and it worked well. Little bit bumpy in places but not a major issue
--------------------------

### Participant 39
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** minimap - didn't need to use camera when navigating corners/obsticles
- **Negative:** d-pad for camera felt a little unnatural wrt. first person view on most games consoles
- **Improvements:** changing between movement/arm roles being on a top trigger (i.e. L1/R1) so not needing to move right thumb between A & Y buttons

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** setting waypoints left more capacity for using the camera to observe the environment whilst robot was self-navigating
- **Negative:** could only set waypoints in area camera could see (versus being able to set waypoints on a map)  key combinations not ideal for a left-handed person - ideally camera pan/tilt would have been on IJKL rather than WASD
- **Improvements:** toggle for left-handed controls

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** had ability to observe environment with camera whilst robot was self-navigating-- with direct control I relied on the mini-map for navigation and didn't use the camera much to observe what the obstacles actually were
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 40
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Wanted to turn the camera-- but the system stopped responding. Had to reload the system.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Good that remotely control the movements. Easy to use. 
- **Negative:** Bit of hard to use the keyboard for control. Better if there is a joystick that control the movement and camera simultaneously. 
- **Improvements:** Adjust the camera with parallel to the motion. 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** No
- **Errors:** No
- **Positive:** The amount of control and the response for controls. 
- **Negative:** Camera movement in the perspective of motion
- **Improvements:** Move the camera with the movement and less of shake

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** More easy to manure and had less issues with controllers. 
- **Anything else:** It would have been better to have more viewing angle and camera movement with relevance to the motion. 
--------------------------

### Participant 41
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** I expected grabbing the target would have required more effort in aligning the arm and end effector but using this system made it more automated and very straightforward than having to control different joints
- **Errors:** There were no errors-- the task went smoothly
- **Positive:** Being able to move the camera without moving the robot to observe the surroundings-- being able to just point where I want the arm to grab the target and having the process being automated instead of me controlling individual joints/positions-- joystick was easy to use 
- **Negative:** nothing comes to mind
- **Improvements:** Maybe in the future we can control the speed of the robot 

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I felt that it would have been easier than I thought to control the robot-- given that you just point to where the robot needs to go and what direction it needed to face-- still found it easy to do so but involved a bit of thinking sometimes regarding how to place the robot to get to the target quickly 
- **Errors:** can't think of errors-- trial went smoothly
- **Positive:** I think it was incredibly useful especially when parking the robot or wanting it facing a specific way-- it was very accurate. I also found it very useful in avoiding obstacles and crashing into walls
- **Negative:** Not bad or unhelpful but sometimes I forgot that I can still move the robot or change the waypoint while it is moving to a target I specified before-- so I would wait for it and watch it go to the point before remembering that I could actually continue planning/tweeking its position so I felt I could have finished the task even faster if I was more proactive
- **Improvements:** Maybe the robot being less shaky so it was clearer to plan ahead 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Actually I believe a mix of both would be the most perfect scenario. I feel like Direct Control would be more useful in looking around/exploring while Waypoint Control would be immensely useful in getting to a specific location that might be hard to direct the robot to (e.g. narrow passage-- sharp turns-- parking at a specific location while facing a certain direction)
- **Anything else:** The map at the corner of the screen was helpful in the Direct Control scenario to help avoid crashing but I did not look at it at all during the waypoint control as the robot was autonomously creating the trajectory and avoiding obstacles for me
--------------------------

### Participant 42
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** It was a bit difficult to set the next waypoint while the robot was moving.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** The good quality live camera feed and the possibility to pan-tilt the camera while the robot is moving was useful. The arm control interface was extremely easy to use. The path-following controller was good. 
- **Negative:** The mobile platform was shaky-- specially while turning the robot-- affecting the waypoint placement a little bit.
- **Improvements:** Maybe a different type of wheels could help to reduce the camera view shakiness. 

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** Sometimes I mixed the forward-turning navigation commands. There are a lot of sticks/pad and buttons to remember. 
- **Positive:** The robot movement was smooth-- the live camera with pan-tilt movement and overview-map feedbacks were useful to navigate.  
- **Negative:** -
- **Improvements:** Maybe a camera with a larger FOV could help the navigation avoiding the need to pan and tilt reducing the physical/mental workload. 

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Direct control provides a faster navigation and a more precise final location specification in the end-- because it feels more natural to adjust the position/orientation with a joystick.
- **Anything else:** Every aspect of both interfaces was very well put together in the system. It was easy to perform a very complicated task in terms of navigation and manipulation.

### Participant 43
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Initially off put by the delay in response from submitting the command to the arm. Became less concerned when I realised the ball changed from white to yellow to confirm the command had been received.
- **Errors:** No errors
- **Positive:** Separate vision and motion control felt intuitive.  Automatic placement of the arm to a target location significantly streamlined the pickup/put down process.
- **Negative:** Steering was a little jerky.
- **Improvements:** Slightly smoother motion. Option to move faster on straight sections.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Robot would occasionally follow a path I didn't expect but still achieved the correct end result.
- **Errors:** No errors
- **Positive:** Use of waypoints made multi tasking much easier-- it was easy to look around the environment and plan my next steps.
- **Negative:** The lack of manual control sometimes felt a bit restrictive. But system still performed well with the given inputs.
- **Improvements:** Ability to plan multiple steps-- perhaps via the minimap?

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Preferred the control on the joystick as it felt more immersive-- though on multi stage tasks or tasks requiring additional environmental observation I would probably prefer the waypoint control. 
- **Anything else:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** I expected the robot to move seamlessly and it did. 
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Control system and vision 
- **Negative:** none
- **Improvements:** It would be helpful if the robot could see or scan what is happing behind it

#### Preference: Direct Control

### Participant 45
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** When the arm dropped the barrel-- I expected to be from the left hand size but the arm towards right-- although it placed the object at the right target location.
- **Errors:** No errors happened
- **Positive:** Vision and navigation system
- **Negative:** A bit jerky movements of the wheel/turns
- **Improvements:** smooth control movements

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** None
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** No need to think about every control step-- just the end configuration and let the robot do it.
- **Negative:** None
- **Improvements:** Maybe the camera could move dynamically 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Direct control required to check that the robot does not bump into nearby object and do mental waypoint calculation while all these are not required by the waypoint control system. 
- **Anything else:** No

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Useful in retrieving objects without putting having to use humans or animals to retrieve them
- **Negative:** There weren't many bad things but a slightly shaky camera made it slightly more difficult.
- **Improvements:** Maybe add some sort of suspension to it so the camera is more sturdy

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** nan
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** I found it easier to use compared to the target controls as you were able to make small adjustments easily.
- **Negative:** I didn't use the camera that much compared to when I used the target controls.
- **Improvements:** The camera control could be bound to the other joystick making it easier to use and be used more frequently.

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** It was easier to make smaller adjustments with the joystick controls while moving the base and the arm.
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 48
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Going in small ramp and different floor conditions. Robot movement was steady but placements could be a bit tricky to use if not focusing camera correctly
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** interactive and easy to use
- **Negative:** waiting for positioning can be set incorrectly if camera is not properly placed while moving (for steady consistent movement)
- **Improvements:** more action buttons

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** expectations were for controllers to have ability to change command buttons or assign different actions
- **Errors:** none
- **Positive:** more interactive-- less wait time-- more control
- **Negative:** control settings
- **Improvements:** less buttons to control 

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** waypoint control was simpler but took a bit more time to adjust. Direct control was somewhat hard to get use to but took less time when actually done
- **Anything else:** control settings for both to change actions for movement and views and grab
--------------------------

### Participant 49
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** when reversing I got the direction of reverse mixed up with the joystick-- I demanded the wrong direction from my intended direction
- **Errors:** Ran over/ drove into the edge of one of the cones. Camera view made it difficult to judge distance between robot and nearby objects when they are close. With practice I wouldn't have this problem.
- **Positive:** Simple controls-- particularly only the control of end effector xyz and not joint angles.
- **Negative:** Camera shaking
- **Improvements:** smoother motion

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** when reversing away from collected target it rotated in unexpected ways to achieve target orientation and position. I expected it to take the shortest rotational path.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** the way point target icon helped imagine the device in the available space and account for turning arc etc
- **Negative:** couldnt fully predict its motion to demanded waypoint-- uncertainty in motion made control more uncomfortable. Lots of keyboard buttons hard to remember without reminder page.
- **Improvements:** less buttons to remember

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Felt more in control of Joystick control-- less uncertainty in its motion. With Waypoint control I felt I had to think further in advance of the desired path to account for potential strange paths (e.g. turning on spot etc) making it more mentally demanding.

- **Unexpected:** Not an error. I was impressed/surprised it could route itself most of the way back by itself.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Robot could position itself accurately
- **Negative:** N/a
- **Improvements:** nan

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** The robot did not always pick up the yellow drum when instructed
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Direct control increases confidence that it won't crash
- **Negative:** Requires substantially more concentration.
- **Improvements:** It would be nice if the camera was linked up the the left analogue stick-- and moved in a smooth motion.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Less brain power required-- so less likely to make silly mistake
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 51
**Interface:** Screen
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Accidently using WASD keys instead of arrow keys- robot camera moved-- not waypoint. Scrolling the wrong way on the mousewheel caused rotation of waypoint in opposite direction to expected. 
- **Errors:** Failed the first grab because the robot was not close enough also in the correcting movement to get close the robot bumped into the box. It was human error-- although some sort of HUD indicator to help show correct distance would have minimised the risk of error.
- **Positive:** Removed the need to think about navigation of obstacles/corners
- **Negative:** No rear camera for reversing. Direct control of waypoint with arrow keys is cumbersome compared to direct control of motion.
- **Improvements:** Adding a direct control mode for turning-- rear camera for waypoint setting when robot is boxed in at the front.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** There was a long delay before placing(?) the object-- I pressed A several more times and it did it eventually. Accidental use of WASD again rather than the direct controls
- **Errors:** No errors-- however on parking I was a bit lost trying to find the zone. The camera was pretty helpful. In fact I underused it in the first trial for looking behind/down.
- **Positive:** The camera was pretty nice for keeping aware of everything. Fairly responsive driving
- **Negative:** Relative to the waypoint system-- it was more difficult to navigate obstacles and there was less time where you sit back and let it drive. I found the joystick a little imprecise on occasion too when I was trying to go directly forwards.
- **Improvements:** Proximity detectors on all sides so you can get through gaps more easily.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Waypoint is my preference primarily because you don't have to focus on avoiding obstacles. A lot of it is sitting back and letting it attain the desired position
- **Anything else:** No

### Participant 52
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Pressed the Y button twice as it seemed unresponsive. Grey ball turned red. Wsa unsure what that meant. It worked anyway.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Easy to use. quite intuitive.
- **Negative:** Cannot see controller in picture. Need to remember location of buttons
- **Improvements:** Seeing the controller.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** With the waypoint placement-- sometimes the robot image was partially through the floor which was a little disconcerting.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** Being able to queue up waypoints whilst the robot was moving was good-- although took a bit of practice to get used to as the camera would move as the robot was moving affecting placement.
- **Negative:** Number of controls was higher necessitating more to remember in a short trial. Although it appears a simple enough system so would be easy to learn with a small amount of practice.
- **Improvements:** The image of the robot placement was sometimes inconsistent. (sometimes disappeared through the floor)

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Being part of the original Playstation generation-- it felt very natural to use the joystick control and have immediate movement of the robot. However-- I think with practice the Waypoint control could be quicker and safer but it felt an unnatural control to me initially. By the end of the run-- it seemed to be getting faster/better.
- **Anything else:** nan

### Participant 53
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** Sometimes I got a bit confused about where the camera was pointing while the robot was moving in a different direction. It would have been nice to have a 'centering' button that returned the camera to the forwards direction with a single click.
- **Errors:** No errors
- **Positive:** Very easy to set the target position and heading-- once I had got used to the controls. It was nice to be able to set the target and then leave the robot to do the work of getting there.
- **Negative:** When I was looking with the camera in a different direction to the movement direction of the robot-- it sometimes got a bit confusing about where I was looking relative to the robot wheelbase.
- **Improvements:** As previously mentioned-- it would have been good to have a 'centering' button to move the camera back to the 'directly forwards' position (relative to the wheelbase) with a single click.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** No
- **Errors:** Occasionally I pressed the wrong buttons-- because there were no virtual handsets in the VR display and I could not see which button my fingers were pressing. If the joystick control had a virtual display-- I think that would solve the problem.
- **Positive:** You could do continuous and smooth control much better. 
- **Negative:** Lack of handset displays in the VR headset was a noticeable problem. I could not always tell which buttons I was pushing-- and made one or two errors.
- **Improvements:** A virtual display of the joystick control-- which indicates which buttons my fingers were touching-- would have been very useful.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** It was easier to set the robot a long-range manoeuvre and then leave it to do its job and just monitor it. That won out over joystick control (although not by much). However-- for short/close manoeuvring-- the joystick system was slightly easier because I could do very small but continuous and smooth movements to get the robot back into its starting box.
- **Anything else:** Both systems had their advantages and disadvantages-- for different aspects of different control tasks. A hybrid system using both modes might actually be the best design choice of all.

### Participant 54
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** WC First

#### Trial 1 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** I expected the system to work like VR game-- I was surprised that it functioned almost exactly like a VR game.
- **Errors:** No error happened in my experience. 
- **Positive:** People will find it easy to pick up and use. It will also help people remotely handle toxic material.
- **Negative:** The VR system might cause vertigo and motion sickness.
- **Improvements:** Try stabilising the camera to minimise motion sickness.

#### Trial 2 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** I expected it to control like vehicle in a video game. It controlled almost exactly like a vehicle in a video game
- **Errors:** No errors occurred during my experience.
- **Positive:** Very easy to use-- will help deal with toxic materials remotely.
- **Negative:** Nothing it was great! Just a small chance of getting motion sick.
- **Improvements:** Nothing really-- its a great system. Maybe stabilise the camera for motion sickness.

#### Preference: Direct Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Played a lot of PlayStation growing up. 
- **Anything else:** Nothing I can think of. Overall a great system.

### Participant 55
**Interface:** VR Headset
**Order:** DC First

#### Trial 1 (Direct Control)
- **Unexpected:** Placing the ball in order to pick up the barrel was more difficult than the other tasks because the ball shifted erratically with my head movements.
- **Errors:** nan
- **Positive:** it can place barrels and move.
- **Negative:** the light was too bright in my eyes (too much glare) and the latency was a little too high so can cause motion sickness.
- **Improvements:** improve latency and reduce glare.

#### Trial 2 (Waypoint Control)
- **Unexpected:** same as last time.
- **Errors:** same as last time.
- **Positive:** same as last time.
- **Negative:** same as last time.
- **Improvements:** same as last time.

#### Preference: Waypoint Control
- **Reasons for preference:** Felt automated. I didn't have to concern myself with turning in the moment.
- **Anything else:** waypoint was more fun.
